# Copy a conversation

Usually you can copy just a message that the AI bot sent back to your clipboard, or you can copy the whole conversation.

To copy a single message, follow these steps:

1. Use the icon `Copy Message` aside a message to copy just that one message
2. Once copied you can paste the message anywhere with CMD+V, CTRL+V or by right click and clicking paste in the place you need it


If you need to copy the whole conversation then:

1. Use the icon `Copy Conversation` from the sidebar menu
2. Once copied you can paste the conversation anywhere with CMD+V, CTRL+V or by right click and clicking paste in the place you need it
