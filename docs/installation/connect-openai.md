# Connect OpenAI

This app uses ChatGPT AI to generate content, so connecting your own OpenAI API key is needed. Don't be down, this is great! This way you can transparently and easily control your AI expenses which can be way, way lower than a basic subscription to any third party AI service. By signing up to use OpenAI ChatGPT API you'll receive free $5 worth of credit.

For the free credit received ($5) you can generate roughly 220 images and the quality content to go along with. So, it can be a nice way to meet AI for the first time.

OpenAI API use has transparent pricing. Generating an image costs $0.02, GPT 3.5Turbo is $0.002 / 1K tokens and using the GPT 4+ is set to $0.06 / 1K tokens. These are all your costs.
